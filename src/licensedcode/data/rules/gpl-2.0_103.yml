    This is the next version of the GPL text as published by the FSF.
    Let's call it the GPL 2.0.3
    This variation was published around about the time of the FSF office
    move on May 1, 2005 from Temple Place to Franklin Street and slighlty
    after the corresponding HTML version.

    In this text version, it refers to the Franklin Street address rather than
    Franklin St and uses the GNU Library General Public License references
    throughout.
