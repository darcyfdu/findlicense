notes: >-
    This text is from the GPL 2.0 with a manual replacement to make it look like an
    LGPL 2.1 notice. This introduces a bias in license detection towards GPL 2.0 when
    this is really an LGPL 2.1 license. This weird license header was originally found
    in the source code  of the http://sourceforge.net/projects/glassbox/ project.
